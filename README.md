# react-native-contacts-typescript
## This is my implementation to a contacts list written with Typescript and React Native.
### What's done already
This is a simple implentation I did for a contacts list app written in react native and typescript.
This app should run both in android and ios devices altough I only checked that the android version is working.
The random users are being generated from a 3rd part API ("https://api.randomuser.me/") and called in an Asynchronous manner and one by one.

- [x] Create relevant components
- [x] Create a Contacts screen
- [x] Create an info Screen for each contact
- [x] Get random user's info from "https://api.randomuser.me/"
- [x] make use of typescript
- [x] make the calls to the server in Asynchronous manner
- [ ] write more tests and improve types

This is an open source project, if someone wants to use it, go ahead and do it :blush: . 

If someone want to make improvements on what I already did you are welcome to do it as well :smile: .
